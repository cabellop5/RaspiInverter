# RASPI INVERTER

Raspi Inverter is a small PHP app to collect data from inverter Axpert MKS (maybe should be compatible with more inverters).

Is ready to take the data through a usb port of a raspberry pi, although any Unix system should be compatible

This data are prepared and insert in InfluxDB for show in Grafana panels.

Soon I will add the links to grafana dashboard and improvements.
